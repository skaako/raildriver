# raildriver
Custom Raildriver DLL for using custom hardware with Train Sim World 2

This is still very much a work in progress...

### XINPUT VERSION

This allows game controllers to be used. I use x360ce https://www.x360ce.com/ to map my controls to an emulated Xbox 360 Controller. Use anything other than Controller 1 as this controller is mapped to the usual Train Sim World 2 controller functions. The DLL will pickup only one controller that is not mapped to controller 1.

I have tested it with a PS4 controller mapped to Controller 2 for example to test it. Going into the Raildriver Calibrate settings in TSW2 will allow you to check it.

Here is how the DLL interprets the game controller axis...

Reverser - Left Thumbstick X  
Throttle/Brake - Left Thumbstick Y  
Automatic Brake - Right Thumbstick X  
Independent Brake/Bail-off* - Right Thumbstick Y  
Rotary Switch 1 - Left Trigger  
Rotary Switch 2 - Right Trigger  

*\*Note: The bail-off control on the original Raildriver is a 0-255 analog value like the rest. I have set it up so to use bail-off hold the DPad Up Button. The Bail-Off value will be that of the Right Thubstick Y and Independent Brake value will be 0. (Let me know if this needs work as I'm not famililar with the outputs of the actual Raildriver)*

To install just replace the original DLL*. On my installation the folder is...
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Train Sim World 2\WindowsNoEditor\TS2Prototype\Binaries\ThirdParty\PieHid\Binaries

*\*Note: Tested non-working with Train Sim World 2 Epic Games Store version*

Custom XInput controller with Arduino Leonardo: I have tested this with the XInput library and have been sucessful. Follow the intructions for using XInput once the Arduino XInput Library has been installed.



### SERIAL PORT VERSION

INI file has to go into C:\Windows folder to work in TSW2. Set the com port in the INI file to connect to your Arduino (Test code included)

Arduino sends the string 'Output: xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx' xxx is the output to each analog channel that the Raildriver outputs. Each output has to be 3 characters to keep the string length consistant. As you can see in the Arduino code I have added padding for numbers under 10 and under 100 that require it.

The 7 channels output are in the order Reverser, Throttle, Auto Brake, Independent Brake, Bail Off, Top Rotary Switch, Bottom Rotary Switch. These are 8 bit channels (0 - 255)

I haven't implemented any of the buttons yet. 

I have had the speed output working but didn't find it useful enough for my case.



### SPLITTING COMBINED THROTTLE AND BRAKE

The combined throttle and brake in the Raildriver control is sent over Byte 2 (Throttle). To split this you can use one pot connected to the Arduino as the Throttle to output 128 to 255. Then use another pot to go from 127 to 0 for braking. The braking pot should override the Throttle pot.



## INSTALLATION

Just rename the original pieHid64.dll and put the new one in the folder. Rename them back if you need the original or if program crashes.
Put INI file into C:\Windows folder. Edit Port to the com port of your Arduino. COM3 COM5 etc.

On my installation the folder is...
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Train Sim World 2\WindowsNoEditor\TS2Prototype\Binaries\ThirdParty\PieHid\Binaries



## VERSION HISTORY

2.0.0.1    XInput Version - Allows XInput controller to be used to supply TSW2 with data. Use a program like x360ce to map your controllers, throttles etc.

1.0.0.2    Added INI file for setting serial port. Keep in the format COM1 COM2 COM3 etc.

1.0.0.1    First Version - Only works on COM3
